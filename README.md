# Audio Transcription and Translation
This project enables audio recording, transcription, and translation using deep learning models. The script records audio, transcribes it using OpenAI's Whisper model, and translates the transcription from English to Malay using Facebook's M2M100 model.

## Features
- Audio Recording: Records audio for a specified duration and saves it as a .wav file.
- Transcription: Uses Whisper to transcribe audio to text.
- Translation: Translates English transcription to Malay with M2M100.
- Timestamps: Saves transcription with timestamps for each segment.
## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- CUDA-enabled GPU (Optional for better performance)
